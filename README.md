## What is it?

Bot Framework currently supports these [Channels](https://docs.botframework.com/en-us/faq/#what-channels-does-the-bot-framework-currently-support) out of the box. To create support for your own channel, you need to use Direct Line to expose your bots to your channel. This HipChat Channel for Bot Framework is a demonstration of how to implement your own channel support for bot framework bots.
